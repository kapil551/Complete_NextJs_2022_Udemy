1. What is Next.js?

    - It is a framework build on ```top of React``` that gives you the ```flexibility``` of building scalable apps by allowing you to ```render content on the server```.

    - It is a framework that allows you to build react apps but render content on the server in advance.

    - Next.js is a ```FULL STACK``` framework.

    - You won't just be building the frontend of the application, but also the backend as well, because ```next.js``` provides us with  a ```node.js server out of the box```.

    - in React, you always render content on the ```client```. There is no server.

    - But with next.js, you can choose to do that on the ```client```, on the ```server``` or a ```mix of both```, you can choose to render on client in your browser on one page, but as choose to do something else on the server on another page next.js is a really flexible, And this is why you are able to build really scalable and highly performant applications because of this ```hybrid approach```.
